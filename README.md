## ✨ How It Works

- Each box in the grid listens for a click event.
- Players alternate turns, placing their symbol (X or O).
- The game checks for win conditions after each move.
- If a player wins, the winning boxes are highlighted.
- If all boxes are filled without a winner, it's a draw.
- The game can be restarted anytime using the "Restart 🔁" button.
